🖥️ SQL Queries on Cosmetics Dataset

Using 'pandasql', I explored product trends using SQL syntax:

    -Average price by category 
    -Top rated and most reviewed products
    -Product distribution across platforms
    -Availability breakdown by category 

    **These queries demonstrate SQL logic applied directly to a real-world dataset**

    -Add product-level forecasting or clustering
    -Extend analysis to include customer reviews and sentiment
